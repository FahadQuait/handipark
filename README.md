# Handipark

Handipark is an Android app for finding handicap parking in Arab countries. 

### Problem

Currently, finding handicap parking spaces is difficult because:
- There are no tools to help find the nearest handicap parking spaces
- Many facilities do not have enough handicap parking spaces
- Other drivers might park illegally in handicap parking spots

### Solution

Handipark is an Android app that would help diabled drivers find parking handicap parking spaces and report parking violations. A disabled driver can open the app and find all the nearby handicap parking spaces and navigate to any of those spaces. If he or she sees a parking violation, he or she can easily report it by simply taking a photo of the violation, and the app will automatically send the photo and the location where the photo is taken to the appropriate local authorities. 

Additionally, diabled drivers can add or remove handicap parking spots in the app if they discover a new handicap space or find incorrect information in the app, so that parking information would be kept up-to-date via crowdsourcing.
